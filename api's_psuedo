<!--the finishing touches that i have just not been able to figure out. -->

1. i need to get the var spotify = new Spotify on line(keys.spotify) to read as a constructor.... if i had more time i would try to figure it out, but if i am to keep to my schedule i will need to turn it in.
2. imdb api key has had some difficulty working under the parameters i have set......... code needs to be adjusted to implement the api key better, or importing the key from the .env file like spotify or twitter.
